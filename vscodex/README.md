Modern LLMs make it easy to “vibe code”. But as your app grows, features break, code bloat creeps in and the big picture fades. 

**vmblu** fixes that by making your architecture *structured, visual, and AI-native*. With vmblu, you can co-write your project with an LLM while keeping the architecture clear, the codebase maintainable, and the system navigable.

## `▞   What is vmblu?`

**vmblu** is a graphical editor, format spec and tool set, for building software as a **network of message-passing nodes**. **vmblu** makes the architecture of your software explicit and easy to navigate — by humans and LLMs.

**vmblu** is 
- **AI-native** - LLMs can design the architecture, write the code and interact with the running system.
- A **visual modeler** - makes your architecture explicit and navigable  
- A **runnable scaffold** - models execute via the vmblu runtime  
- **Framework-agnostic** - use any stack or package, from JS/TS to Svelte or Three.js  

The **vmblu model** is not documentation, it is the actual system.

## `▞   vmblu is for developers`

- **vmblu** is a tool targeted at developers whose role is changing with the arrival of powerful AI.
- **vmblu** is for building real, complex systems. It is an excellent foundation to build agentic systems. 
- **Message-based architectures** — the foundation of vmblu — bring their own advantages.
- **Migrating** an application to a **vmblu** based design is not complicated. The vmblu editor itself is now a vmblu application.
- **vmblu** is currently at version 0.0.21, with version 1.0.0 planned in the first quarter of the year (2026). It is in good shape, but expect updates.
