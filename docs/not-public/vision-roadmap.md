## 🟦 Vision and roadmap

AI is changing software development and gives you the power to develop in a fraction of the time and effort required before. But it comes with new challenges: 

- keeping the overview and understand what is happening in the generated codebase
- splitting the work to be done in meaningful parts that can be worked on in parallel

It is crystal clear that the role of AI in software engineering will only grow fuelling a second equally important trend, that as the development of software becomes faster, more reliable and coste effective because, demand for performant systems will increase.

So what is there to do

Improving what exists

- Adding features like areas (ongoing) and interface connections (ongoing)
- Make autorouting & placement of nodes more sophisticated - also involve AI in this
- Increase the automatic test surface

Bigger areas to work on short term

- Extend to other languages and runtimes
- Run nodes in workers or on other systems - expand the runtime comms system
- Use the editor as a runtime dashboard - reconfigure a running system
